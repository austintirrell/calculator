## What I learned
This project took some spare time out of my weekend from start to finish. It has helped me grasp a more complex application and all the features that might be needed. It has helped me to rely on developer tools in Chrome to help debug, and figure out the error in my logic. Another thing that helped debugging. was rubber duck debugging. That just means explain the process of the application in plain english out loud. This helped a lot.

## Something I wish I did better at
I really wish I did better with notes and readability of my code. It was kind of a rush app that I wanted done in 2 days. If I go back in to add keyboard functionality or other functions such as percentages, I would like to clean up the code and add notes to help others see whats actually happening and why something had to be introduced.
